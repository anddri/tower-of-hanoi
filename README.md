# tower-of-hanoi
A 'Tower of Hanoi' algorithm implemented in Python

## Just for the fun of it

Read about recursion, and stumbled over a solution to the *Tower of hanoi* using recursion. It was originally written in Java, so I just quickly rewrote it in Python - just so I could send it to a friend.

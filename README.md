# tower-of-hanoi
A 'Tower of Hanoi' algorithm implemented in Python

## How to

Just run the script, and use as commandline argument the number of disks you have.

So for exmple if you play Tower of Hanoi with 4 disks, you write

´´´
python tower_of_hanoid.py 4
´´´

## Just for the fun of it

Read about recursion, and stumbled over a solution to the *Tower of hanoi* using recursion. It was originally written in Java, so I just quickly rewrote it in Python - just so I could send it to a friend.
